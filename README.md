Welcome! This Discord bot is designed to provide real-time weather, climate, and forecast information for any city. With a user-friendly interface and a range of commands, weather bot allows users to easily retrieve accurate weather data without leaving their Discord server. Powered by [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/), the bot offers comprehensive weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and more. Whether you're planning a trip, checking the weather in your area, or just curious about the conditions in a different city, weather bot has you covered. Stay informed and prepared with the latest weather updates, all at your fingertips!
## How to Get
- You can invite the bot to your own discord server [here]().
- Once the bot is in your server, use the `w!help` command to get started

## NOTE
Apologies beecause this bot's code has not been hosted anywhere yet which is also why I also have not uploaded it anywhere for invites yet.

## Some Screenshots for proof that it exists and works
